    <p id="p1">
    The Steam Deck is fundamentally just a PC.
    It uses standard PC hardware and runs standard PC operating systems like Linux and Windows.<br>
    Valve's Pierre-Loup Griffais revealed hardware specifications to IGN.<br>
    Every Steam Deck uses the AMD Zen 2 CPU and RDNA 2 GPU architecture, and they all come with 16GB of RAM. And of course, it has Wi-Fi and Bluetooth.<br>
    The Steam Deck is a portable device with built-in controls---whether you prefer touchpads or joysticks, the Steam Deck has them.<br>
    It has a seven-inch screen with 1280x800 resolution (that's a 16:10 aspect ratio).<br>
    The screen has ambient light sensors to automatically adjust brightness, just like a modern mobile device.<br>
    Valve says you'll get between two and eight hours of battery life depending on what you're doing.<br>
    It comes with a carrying case for portability, too.<br>
    Valve will also produce a docking station, giving you a way to dock the Steam Deck and play your games on a TV or monitor.<br>
    But any USB-C dock will work with it: Again, it's a PC.<br>
