        The Oculus Quest 2 has been engineered to make virtual worlds adapt to your movements, <br>
        letting you explore awe-inspiring games and experiences with unparalleled freedom without a PC or console.<br>
        Stay focused with a stunning display that features 50% more pixels than the original Quest.<br>
        The redesigned Touch controllers feature improved ergonomics and intuitive controls that transport your gestures, motions and actions directly into VR.<br>
        You can even connect your VR headset to a gaming-compatible computer with an Oculus Link cable to access hundreds of PC VR games and experiences.<br>
        Quest 2 also lets you bring your friends into the action.
        With live casting, you can share your VR experience with people around you.<br>
        Or meet up with friends in virtual worlds to battle in multiplayer competitions or just spend some time together.<br>
        With Oculus Quest 2, thereâ€™s no end in sight to what you can play, create and discover in virtual reality.<br>
